This dataset includes raw T1-weighted, diffusion MRI and functional MRI (task and resting) scans from healthy controls and patients with focal dystonia (cervical dystonia and upper limb dystonia). Processed data may be available in future release. All data were collected at Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein using a Siemens MAGNETOM Prisma 3.0 Tesla MRI scanner equipped with a 64-channel head coil. All data are de-identified and shared in compliance with ethical and legal guidelines. The dataset supports investigations into the neural correlates of focal dystonia. This dataset is made available under the Creative Commons Zero (CC0) v1.0 License.

Participants were adults aged 18 to 78 years, literate in Portuguese, and right-handed. Patients were diagnosed with idiopathic focal dystonia according to current criteria and were recruited from movement disorder clinics and public advertisements. Healthy control participants were free of any neurological or psychiatric conditions. Exclusion criteria included any other neurological or psychiatric diagnosis, prior neurosurgery, moderate-to-severe head trauma, cancer, uncontrolled metabolic conditions, current or past use of neuroleptics, history of substance abuse, or contraindications for MRI scanning such as claustrophobia or the presence of metal implants. All participants provided written informed consent, and the study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Hospital do Servidor Público Estadual, and Universidade Federal de São Paulo.

Clinical assessments included the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale (BFMDRS) for all patient participants. Demographic data were collected, including age and sex. Clinical information regarding distonia groups [upper limb dystonia (ULD), cerivical dystonia (CD) and healthy controls (HC)],BFMDRS score, age at acquisition and sex are provided in particapts.tsv.


T1w: Structural MRI data were acquired using a T1-weighted MPRAGE sequence with the following parameters: repetition time of 2500 ms, echo time of 3.47 ms, inversion time of 1100 ms, flip angle of 7 degrees, matrix size of 256 × 256, 192 sagittal slices with no gap, and isotropic voxel dimensions of 1.0 × 0.5 × 0.5 mm. The acquisition time for this sequence was 2 minutes and 34 seconds.
DWI:  Diffusion-weighted images were collected with 60 diffusion directions at a b-value of 1000 s/mm² and 9 interleaved b0 images. The phase-encoding direction was anterior-posterior, with an additional reverse phase-encoding acquisition for distortion correction. Diffusion parameters included a repetition time of 3151 ms, echo time of 84.2 ms, voxel size of 2 mm isotropic, and 69 axial slices covering the entire brain.

T2w(task-rest):Functional sequence [BOLD echo planar imaging (EPI)—resting state]: TR 900 ms, TE 33 ms, flip angle 52 deg, matrix  64 ×74mm2, thickness 2 mm, gap 0.6 mm, and a total of 192 volumes.Resting-state images were acquired during 6 min 11 s. Participants were instructed to stay awake, relaxed, with eyes open and fixed on a projected bright cross hair on a dark background.

T2w(task-finger): BOLD EPI—task of opposition of the fingers to the thumb-finger taps: TR 2000 ms, TE 25 ms, flip angle 67 deg, matrix  64×74mm2, thickness 2.5 mm, gap 0.6 mm, and a total of 108 volumes. Acquisition time: 12 min.  The finger-tapping task consisted of 12 blocks, which contained one of three different conditions (four blocks each): right hand and left hand or both hands; each block lasted 30 s, followed by an interval of 30 s when subjects were instructed to remain still. Volunteers had to oppose the fingers to the thumb, starting from the index finger to the little finger, repeating the same sequence as fast and accurately as possible. Blocks were randomized using the E-Prime® 2.0 software. Finger tapping on block onset, durantion and task condicition can be found in task-finger_events.tsv in 'func' folder.


Of the 112 participants initially enrolled in the study, four were excluded due to incidental MRI findings and 16 were excluded due to technical artifacts. The final dataset includes high-quality imaging data from 37 healthy controls, 25 patients with cervical dystonia, and 29 patients with upper limb dystonia. Anotomical images have been de-identified using Pydeface 2.0.2.
